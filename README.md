To replicate the experiments from the paper (folder [tests](https://github.com/nellro/time-robust-control/tree/main/tests)), you will also need: 
- MATLAB.
- [YALMIP toolbox](https://yalmip.github.io/).
- [Gurobi optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/).
  - if you don't want to install Gurobi, you might use any other solver you prefer ([mosek](https://www.mosek.com/), for instance). Computation times might change.
